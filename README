SceneBuilder is the next generation of NodeBox: a node-based interface to Processing for visual coders. 

SceneBuilder can be considered to be in "alpha" state: it runs, but a lot of important features are still missing. Do not depend on it for day-to-day work, and don't forget to save early and often!

To start hacking on it:

  git clone git://github.com/nodebox/scenebuilder.git
  cd scenebuilder
  ant run

To make a full Mac app:

  ant dist-mac

The resulting DMG file is in dist/mac/Scenebuilder-[version].dmg

Note that the application does not run from the DMG: copy the app to the desktop first.
